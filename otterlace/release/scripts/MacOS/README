The scripts in this directory and corresponding config files in
otterlace/release/etc/MacOS should allow an ab-initio build of the Mac
otterlace environment, and then of annotools and otterlace itself.

Recipe:

cd ~/Dist # or wherever you want to do your app building

setup_app_skeleton.sh otterlace.app

  # sets up the otterlace.app directory tree, including symlinks out
  # of the tree for var and share. attempts to share macports
  # distfiles if appropriate.


cd otterlace.app

install_macports.sh

  # downloads, configures and installs MacPorts for and into the app
  # tree. sets up a local tree for locally-patched port
  # files. generates the port_update.sh script and prompts for:

# connect to non-rsync-firewalled network and run:
./Contents/Resources/sbin/port_update.sh

# connect back to normal network if necessary.


install_ports.sh

  # uses MacPorts to install all the ports listed in
  # etc/MacOs/ports.list


install_cpan_bundle.sh

  # configures cpan and sets up the distroprefs mechanism to tailor
  # the installation of some modules.  uses cpan to install the
  # modules listed in etc/MacOS/Bundle/Otterlace/MacOS.pm
  # (which are not available in MacPorts)


install_annotools_prereqs.sh <path to zmap build directory>

  # compiles and installs ACEDB and libAceConn, which don't need to
  # be reinstalled every time there's a new ZMap.


install_annotools.sh <path to zmap build directory>

  # configures, compiles and installs ZMap, SeqTools and XRemote.


install_otterlace.sh <path to ensembl-otter git checkout>

  # runs otterlace_build with suitable arguments to install
  # otter client.


TBC: set up Contents/MacOS/otterlace script and plist file.

  # copy Contents/MacOS/otterlace from another of my builds
  #   edit OTTER_HOME to point to correct version
  #   ensure it sets OTTER_MACOS_RESOURCES

  # copy Contents/Info.plist from another otterlace tree
  #   open Info.plist and ensure version strings are correct

  # modify:
  #   Contents/Resources/otter_rel<NN.NN>/bin/otterlace_env.sh
  #   * comment out OTTER_HOME=
  #   * set anasoft from $OTTER_MACOS_RESOURCES
  #   * add to PERL5LIB as per:
