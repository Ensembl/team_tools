The scripts in this directory and corresponding config files in
otterlace/release/etc/MacOS should allow an ab-initio build of the Mac
otterlace environment, and then of annotools and otterlace itself.

Recipe:

cd ~/Dist # or wherever you want to do your app building

setup_app_skeleton.sh otterlace.app

  # sets up the otterlace.app directory tree, including symlinks out
  # of the tree for var and share. attempts to share macports
  # distfiles if appropriate.


cd otterlace.app

install_macports.sh

  # downloads, configures and installs MacPorts for and into the app
  # tree. sets up a local tree for locally-patched port
  # files. generates the port_update.sh script and prompts for:

# connect to non-rsync-firewalled network and run:
./Contents/Resources/sbin/port_update.sh 

# connect back to normal network if necessary.


install_ports.sh

  # uses MacPorts to install all the ports listed in
  # etc/MacOs/ports.list


install_cpan_bundle.sh

  # configures cpan and sets up the distroprefs mechanism to tailor
  # the installation of some modules.  uses cpan to install the
  # modules listed in etc/MacOS/Bundle/Otterlace/MacOS.pm
  # (which are not available in MacPorts)


install_annotools_prereqs.sh <path to zmap build directory>

  # compiles and installs ACEDB and libAceConn, which don't need to
  # be reinstalled every time there's a new ZMap.


install_annotools.sh <path to zmap build directory>

  # configures, compiles and installs ZMap, SeqTools and XRemote.


TBC: actual otterlace install, via otterlace_build??
