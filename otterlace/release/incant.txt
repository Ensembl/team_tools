That I record the commandline I used in here, suggests we need a

mca builds to his home directory & local Apache,

  mkdir ~/_swac
  ln -snvf /software/anacode/lib ~/_swac/
  TT_DEV=/nfs/users/nfs_m/mca/gitwk-anacode/team_tools

  for DISTRO in lenny lucid; do
    otter_nfswub=~/_httpd/OTTER build_log=~/_swac/build_log.yaml otter_suffix=arch:distro client_build_hosts="$DISTRO-dev32 $DISTRO-dev64" otter_swac=~/_swac  $TT_DEV/otterlace/release/scripts/otterlace_build ~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.$DISTRO
  done


building 58.* releases,

  cd ~/gitwk-anacode/eo.58
  otter_suffix=distro client_build_hosts="lenny-dev32 lenny-dev64" $ANACODE_TEAM_TOOLS/otterlace/release/scripts/otterlace_build ~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.lenny
  otter_suffix=distro client_build_hosts="lucid-dev32 lucid-dev64" $ANACODE_TEAM_TOOLS/otterlace/release/scripts/otterlace_build ~mca/gitwk-anacode/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.lucid

    Lucid zmap build was copied (~450M) & hacked with renames to deal with
