That I record the commandline I used in here, suggests we need a
config file for the build.  YAML input to select options?  It would
save re-quoting the environment variables, too.

        (still true, but much improved now)


assume
  PATH=$PATH:$ANACODE_TEAM_TOOLS/otterlace/release/scripts


build to home directory & local Apache,

  mkdir -p ~/_swac/build_log
  ln -snvf /software/anacode/lib ~/_swac/

  otter_nfswub=~/_httpd/OTTER otter_swac=~/_swac build_log=~/_swac/build_log otter_suffix=arch:distro  otterlace_build ~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.{lenny,lucid}


build only client to home directory (mg13, as of 2011-12-12):

  otterlace_client_host=deskpro18925   \
  otter_swac=~/Work/swac               \
  build_log=~/Work/swac/build_log      \
  zmap_build=~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT   \
  otterlace_build

  NB: (2012-02-22) the above recipe now depends on having put in place:

  mkdir ~/Work/swac/bin
  cp /software/anacode/bin/anacode_distro_code ~/Work/swac/bin
  ln -s /software/anacode/distro ~/Work/swac


otterlace_dev build
  otterlace_build ~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.{lenny,lucid}


building 58.* releases,

  # Build from clean working copy
  cd ~/gitwk-anacode/eo.58
  git branch -v
  git pull

  # tag it
  otterlace_release_tag --minor 58

  # build
  otterlace_build ~zmap/BUILD.DEVELOPMENT.{lenny,lucid}

  # check server status -- LEGACY
  diffdevlive /nfs/WWWdev/SANGER_docs/{lib,data,cgi-bin}/otter/58 | ~mca/bin/ansi_bleach | grep -vE '^ *- *X *X *SANGER'

  # Fix symlinks manually, there is only one now.  Using the script
  # would mean having configuration to drive it,
  # (which is now available)
  ssh lenny-dev32
  otter_rel=otter_rel<major>.<minor>
  otter_track=otter_<track>
  cd /software/noarch/linux-i386/anacode/otter
  ls -l
  ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lenny ${otter_track}; ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lenny ${otter_track}-lenny; ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lucid ${otter_track}-lucid
  cd /software/noarch/linux-x86_64/anacode/otter
  ls -l
  ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lenny ${otter_track}; ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lenny ${otter_track}-lenny; ln -snvf ${otter_rel}-lucid ${otter_track}-lucid

  # wait

Rebuilding just the server

  (to a disposable non-live copy)

    mkdir -p /tmp/junk/{srv,build_log}
    otter_nfswub=/tmp/junk/srv build_log=/tmp/junk/build_log \
      /nfs/users/nfs_m/mca/gitwk-anacode/team_tools.stable/otterlace/release/scripts/otterlace_build --server-only

    # LEGACY!
    diff -ru /tmp/junk/srv/cgi-bin/otter/57 /nfs/WWWdev/SANGER_docs/cgi-bin/otter/57
    diff -ru /tmp/junk/srv/lib/otter/57 /nfs/WWWdev/SANGER_docs/lib/otter/57
