This subproject is intended to hold configuration-like data which
doesn't belong in the ensembl-otter tree, for these reasons

 - it makes no sense to make release branches of things describing
   external data.  e.g. server ensembl version, known-broken columns,
   loutre_$species which are non-production or for testing

 - such configuration files can usefully be versioned in a linear way

 - I have such a file right here, and there is no clearly better place
   to put it
