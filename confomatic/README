Quick utility to maintain a section of ~/.ssh/config with hostname
aliases.

I was expecting this to expand into something for other config
files...


My crontab entry,

  TT_S=/nfs/users/nfs_m/mca/gitwk--bg/team_tools
  37 7 * * *   cd $TT_S/confomatic && bin/config-subst ssh-config.yaml || diff -u ~/.ssh/config~~ ~/.ssh/config


The ssh-config.yaml was maintained by mca ad-hoc until 2015-01, using
something like

  grep -r Hostname: ~user/.otter/
