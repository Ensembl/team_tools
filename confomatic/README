Quick utility to maintain a section of ~/.ssh/config with hostname
aliases.

I was expecting this to expand into something for other config
files...


Incantation for extracting deskpro name from an annotator's otterlace
logs, requires a call to lock_region

  grep -a hostname= ~mca/.otter/otterlace.* | perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /hostname=([-a-z0-9.]+)/' | sort | uniq -c


My crontab entry,

  TT_S=/nfs/users/nfs_m/mca/gitwk--bg/team_tools
  37 7 * * *   cd $TT_S/confomatic && bin/config-subst ssh-config.yaml || diff -u ~/.ssh/config~~ ~/.ssh/config
