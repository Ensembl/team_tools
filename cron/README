This subproject currently holds some of the things mca@deskpro17119
runs from cron.  

See ~mca/cvswork-waypoint/misc/crontab.deskpro17119 for current
details.


  prove_quietly		use the 'prove' tool to run some periodic
  t/			sanity checks.

  bg.mrconfig		config for mr(1) which mca uses to maintain
   [experimental]	~/gitwk--bg/ as a stable production
			environment, separate from other development.

  lib/			modules used only in this subproject.


Anacode::DatabasePasswords may well be generally useful.  If so, it
should be extracted...  but I didn't want a one-file subproject.
