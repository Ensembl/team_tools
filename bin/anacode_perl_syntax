#  This is a wrapper to run Perl in syntax check mode.  It is used by
#  anacode-perl-syntax.pl.

#  We remove any #! line because sometimes they specify -T which
#  causes problems.

#  NB: because we pipe the code to Perl, it always reports the file
#  name as '-'.  This is not a problem as the Emacs buffer displays
#  the file name anyway so it is no loss not to see it a second time.
