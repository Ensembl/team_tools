The plan as I imagine it...


Files on master branch
======================

 bin/	 	things we all want on our $PATH, by some consensus?  Not sure about this.

 t/		tests that can safely be run with no setup or side-effects[1]


Files on branches named $dev/$foo
=================================

If the branch used the filenames pattern above it could merge to
master easily, but naming the branch after a developer suggests the
content is not ready for sharing.



[1] t/otter_databases.t may write a row when things go very wrong, but
will then see this and fail until it is deleted again.
