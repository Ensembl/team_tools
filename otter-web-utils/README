otter-web-utils
===============

An import of Jeremy's web tools (HTML/js/CGI) for examining the otter
databases.

If you have a checkout of anacode/webvm.git at $WEBVM, you should be
able to add these by doing:

( cd $WEBVM/apps             && \
  ln -s $ANACODE_TEAM_TOOLS  && \
  ln -s team_tools/otter-web-utils/conf/60otter-web-utils.conf )

and then restarting your apache.
